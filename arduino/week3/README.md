Looking At Recursion!
Author: Christopher Bartholomew
Course: CS50 

In class experiment on how to interact with the arduino using C's functions and LEDS to look at recursion visually.

Goals:
- Using resursive functions as a method of iteration
- Seeing how functions execute on the stack visually, and how the variables become destroyed as they fall off the stack.
- Building a project using Multiple Lights defined in a global array
- Passing arrays by reference to other functions.
