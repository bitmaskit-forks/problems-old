Overview
========
Welcome to the CS50 repository of ridiculously awesome section problems! We're
hoping to build out this repo to contain a whole bunch of interesting, topical
problems that our Teaching Fellows can use in sections and our students can use
on their own as a way to practice the material presented in class.

Organization
============
Keeping this repository organized is probably the most important thing here.
Right now we've settled on organizing content first by language/domain (Arduino,
C, PHP, etc.) and then by week (e.g., C content that is applicable to week 2 of
CS50 goes in `c/week2`). This might change in the future if we come up with a
better scheme. If you've got an idea for improving this, let us know at
heads@cs50.net

Additionally, we're experimenting with using #tags in the header comments of
each file to indicate what topical content is covered by the file. If you write
some code on `for` loops, make sure to tag the file with something like
`#for #loop` in the header comments.

Contributing
============
Keep problems short: ideal are ones that could be done in 5-10 minutes by
students. If it takes you more than 10 minutes to code up an idea once you've
thought of it, it's probably too long for our needs. And while it's definitely
awesome to have witty/clever problems, it's more important right now to build
up a large corpus of problems. The more you contribute, the better!
