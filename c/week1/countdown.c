* countdown.c

* Fun with loops, sleep, carriage return, user input, and more!
* Inspired by a question on the cs50-discuss google group in June 2012.
* https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cs50-discuss/LRmxL7WCPQc/rLs7_UtDm1sJ
*
* Implement countdown.c according to the following specification:
* The program should begin by asking the user for a number of seconds.
* The number must not exceed 3600.
* Then, countdown from the number of seconds the user
* provided, printing the current time remaining in mm:ss format every second.
*
* After the program has counted down to 0 seconds, exit.

	// TODO: Inside your loop, print the appropriate time in mm:ss format
	// Make sure that you print the time in such a way that allows future "prints" to overwrite your current time
	// You may need to use fflush
