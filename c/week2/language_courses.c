* A particular university identifies its language courses
* with a two character course identifier, in the following
* pattern:
* Aa, Ab, Ba, Bb, Ca, Cb ...
* 0,   1,  2,  3,  4,  5 ...
*
* The courses are sequenced in this order.
* Each course is a one semester course.
*
* Francis wants to write a program that will print out
* the two character identifier for course n in the sequence.
*
* Write a program that gets an integer n from the user,
* and implements this behavior.
*
* To be clear, course 0 corresponds to Aa, and course 4
* corresponds to Ca.  Assume that the highest possible
* course in the sequence is Zb.
*
* With that said, try to limit user input appropriately.
* If the user provides out-of-range input, tell them to give you
* another integer until they provide acceptable input.
*
* There are multiple ways to determine the
* course identifier, but go for correctness first!
