* echo is a Unix command that, according to its man page,
* "display[s] a line of text."
* For example:
* francis@appliance:~$ echo This is CS50!
* This is CS50!
* francis@appliance:~$
*
* Below, try to implement your own version of the echo command.
* - Don't worry about trailing whitespace, but do make sure that
*   the user's string has spaces where appropriate.
* - For simplicity, don't worry about flags.
*
* Possible extensions:
* - Add some Easter eggs.  (Feel free to use this as a platform for self-expression.)
* - Replace your Appliance installation's version of echo with your version of echo.
	(How can you ensure that your version is the one being used :-)?)
* - echo's output can be controlled by some flags, given as
*   command line arguments:
*     francis@appliance:~$ echo -n This is CS50 without the newline character!
*     This is CS50 without the newline character!francis@appliance:~$
*
*   Try handling some or all of echo's flags.  (See the man page for a full list!)
