Adam is at a payphone, trying to call home.  
However, he doesn't remember his phone number! 
Fortunately, he created a program a long time ago that you can use in the Appliance to help him. 
It will print his phone number when given a correct integer argument, as in: 

./phone <correct_passphrase>

If you pass an incorrect passphrase, the program will trigger a segmentation fault.

So what is the correct passphrase? 
All Adam remembers is that the correct passphrase and the user's input are passed into a function called "compare".  
See if you can: 

- Launch gdb.
- Set a breakpoint at the compare function. 
- Run the attached program inside of gdb.
- Use inspection or the printing functionality to determine the correct passphrase.

Then, check your work, either by running the program from gdb or executing it normally!

(Also, make sure you are using the program inside of the CS50 Appliance.)
