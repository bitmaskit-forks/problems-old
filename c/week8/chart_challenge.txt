Imagine that Billboard, the publication that maintains the Hot 100 chart, has a SQL database with a table containing all songs that have ever appeared on the chart.  The table, called "hits", looks something like this: 

|   id   |        title     |      artist       |   highest_chart_position 
     1     "Call Me Maybe"    "Carly Rae Jepsen"             1             

Note: the "id" column is an auto-incrementing primary key.

Billboard needs your help maintaining this database.  See if you can write queries that...

1) ... retrieve the titles of all number one songs. 

2) ... change the highest_chart_position of the song with id #50 to be 3.

3) ... add a song called "Super Malan" by "CorinneandKat" to the database, which peaked at #1 this week.

4) ... remove a song called "The Campfire Song" by "Spongebob" after it was mistakenly added.

5) *Challenge!* ... retrieve a list of all _distinct_ singers on the list, _ordered by_ artist name.
